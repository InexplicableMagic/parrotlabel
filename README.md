# AnnImage
AnnImage is a graphical tool for creating training data for use in image recognition machine learning applications. Images can be annotated with rectangles to mark-up and label regions of interest. Annotations can be exported in JSON, CSV or Pascal VOC (XML) format as used by ImageNet. The labelled images can be used a basis for training various machine learning frameworks including the [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html).
