<h3>Labelling Images</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Click the "Add New Box Category" button</li>

		<li>Optionally enter a single character hotkey.
		<ul><li>When the hotkey is typed the category will be selected</li></ul></li>
		<li>Click Done</li>
		<li>Add more box categories as required to represent further objects you would like to label</li>
		<li>Select a category either by clicking it on the right hand list or typing the hotkey that was set.</li>
		<li>Using the mouse draw one or more boxes anywhere over the image. The drawn boxes will be assigned the selected category.</li>
		<li>If the position of the drawn box is not quite perfect it can be adjusted slightly using the arrow keys whcih will cause the box to be nudged by one pixel</li>
		<li>The width and height of the box can be adjusted using shift+arrow keys</li>
		<li>To zoom in, use Ctrl + the mouse scrollwheel. Alternatively use Ctrl + Up Arrow or Numpad 8 whilst pointing at the position on the image to be zoomed.</li>
		<li>When all required boxes are drawn move to the next image by either clicking "Next" or using Ctrl+the right arrow key. Numpad 6 is a further alternative,</li>
		<li>Previously drawn boxes can be selected by Shift+Click</li>
		<li>The labelled category of boxes can be modified by selecting the required new category and then clicking box while holding down the right Alt key (often labelled Alt Gr)

	</ul>

<h3>Exporting Labelling Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>First save the labelling state using "Save" from the "File" menu. The labeller cannot currently import the export formats, therefore always save a copy in the native format so that the session can be continued later if required.</li>
<li>Choose "Export" from the file menu</li>
<li>Choose either "Pascal VOC" or CSV (comma separated) format as required.</li>
<li>When using Pascal VOC mode, it is the convention that the labelling data for each image is stored in a separate file. Therefore a directory must chosen where the set of files may be saved. Choose the directory and then click "Do Export". A set of XML files will then be written to the directory.
</ul>
