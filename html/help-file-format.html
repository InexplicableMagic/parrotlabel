	<h3>ParrotLabel File Format</h3>
	<p>The native ParrotLabel file format is serialised in JSON and is split into three sections:</p>

	<p>
	<code>{ "file_format": { ... }, "config": { ... }, "labels": [ ... ] }</code>

		<ul>
			<li><b>file_format</b> - contains values used to identify the file format (required)</li>
			<li><b>config</b> - contains configuration values to help restore the users previous labelling session (optional)</li>
			<li><b>labels</b> - contains the image labelling (required)</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>file_format Section</h3>
	<pre><code>
	"file_format": {
		 "name": "ParrotLabel",
		 "magic": "43a04f6d-f95b-41da-8b92-f4c9f859d3fb",
		 "version": 1
	}</code></pre>
	</p><p>
	The <b>name</b> key is the human readable name of the format for the benefit of anyone manually inspecting the file and is always set to "ParrotLabel".
	The <b>magic</b> key always contains the value "43a04f6d-f95b-41da-8b92-f4c9f859d3fb" and is the definitive way to enable a parser 
	to quickly identify the file type and differentiate it from other JSON files. If this key is not present with this exact value then it is 
	not a ParrotLabel file. 
	The <b>version</b> identifies the version of the file. Currently this is always 1.
	</p>
	<h3>config Section</h3>
	<p>This section is optional and used is used for restoring the state of the user's last session. It contains no information of relevance to the image annotations.
	<pre><code>
	"config": {
	    "image_dir_base_path": "/path/to/images",
	    "category_meta_data": [
	      {
		"name": "Parrot",
		"colour": "green",
		"hotkey": "p"
	      }
	    ],
	    "path_last_image_viewed": "subdir/parrot.png"
	  }
	</code></pre>
	</p><p>
	The <b>image_dir_base_path</b> key is the base directory in which the images were last found. All image paths are relative to this location. 
	When the file is opened, as a convenience ParrotLabel will set this as the images directory. However the user can set an alternative location.
	</p><p>
	The <b>category_meta_data</b> section contains an array of objects that define the box label categories that were last set in ParrotLabel when the file was in use. 
	This is not necessarily an exhaustive list of all categories that exist, this section is just a convenience to restore the user interface to the last known state. 
	Box label categories may exist in the file that are not listed in this section. 
	The <b>name</b> key is the name of the category and should be assumed to be UTF-8. 
	The <b>colour</b> is the colour of the box that was last used and uses JavaScript conventions for colour names.
	The <b>hotkey</b> is the keyboard shortcut character that was last set by the user for this category. 
	</p><p>
	<b>path_last_image_viewed</b> is the path relative to "image_dir_base_path" of the image the user was last working on. This is a convenience to be able to
	automatically restore the session at the image last in use.
	</p>
	<h3>labels Section</h3>
	<p>
	<pre><code>
	{
      		"image_width": 1200,
      		"image_height": 900,
      		"image_path": "subdira/ImageP14.jpg",
	      	"box_list": [ ... ]
	}	
	</code></pre>
	</p><p>
	The labels section is an array of objects. There is one object per image. 
	</p><p>
	<b>image_width</b> and <b>image_height</b> are the width and height of the image that was labelled in pixels. These values are optional as this format does not measure in pixels but are included as a convenience for converting to other formats without needing to load the original images to determine the size. This tool does not store the image height and width if an image was never examined. However that should also mean the image is not marked with any boxes and therefore there would be nothing to convert.
	</p><p>
	The key <b>image_path</b> must be present and is the relative path to the image relative to the base directory specified in the  "image_dir_base_path" key. This should follow UNIX style path conventions.
	</p><p>
	<b>box_list</b> is an array of objects. There is one object per labelled box for the image. The array may be empty but the box_list key must be present even is there are no labelled boxes for this image.
	</p><p>
	<pre><code>
	{
          "leftPct": 0.014412416851441241,
          "widthPct": 0.7142857142857143,
          "topPct": 0.23515439429928742,
          "heightPct": 0.7559241706161137,
          "label": "Parrot"
        }
	</pre></code>
	</p><p>
	<b>widthPct</b> is a floating point value between 0 and 1 inclusive and is the width of the drawn box expressed as a percentage of the image width. Hence if the image width is 100 pixels then 0.1 means the box width is 10 pixels. Similarly <b>heightPct</b> is the height of the drawn box expressed as a percentage of the image height.
	</p><p>
	<b>leftPct</b> is a floating point value from zero to just less than 1 and is the left hand edge of the box expressed as a percentage across the image starting at the left edge. If the image is 100 pixels wide, then values greater than and including zero but less than and not including 0.01 refers to the left-most column of pixels. Values from and including 0.01 up to but not including 0.02 means the 2nd column of pixels from the left edge of the image. Technically a value of 1 can never be reached, however due to inevitable rounding errors and as a matter of convenience, the right-most column of pixels should include 1. It would also be prudent to accept any value greater than 1 as meaning the right-most column of pixels in case a floating point calculation rounds to very slightly over 1.
	</p><p>
	<b>topPct</b> works the same as leftPct except it is the distance expressed as a percentage from the top edge of the image to the top edge of the drawn box.
	</p><p>
	<b>label</b> is the category that was applied to the box and should be assumed to be UTF-8.
